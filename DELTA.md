## 2026-04-18T00:00:00Z | staging | local-only recovery baseline

- Intent: recover the usable VK board state, remove active cloud coupling, and make the local install restorable.
- Completed:
  - imported the VK cloud export into the local SQLite DB
  - switched the live runtime to local-only behavior (`shared_api_base: null`)
  - restored project settings, local columns, issue creation, workspace linking, and workspace history scroll
  - added lean backup + one-click restore scripts
  - installed hourly backup cron with Desktop archive mirroring
- Verified:
  - local API reports `shared_api_base: null`
  - project boards and issues load locally
  - backups are created locally and mirrored to Desktop
- Not complete / known gaps:
  - some historic metadata can only be reconstructed if present in export or DB snapshots
  - project-scoped PR fallback is still broader than it should be

## 2026-04-18T23:00:00Z | staging | vibe-kanban project smoke test

- Intent: prove the `vibe-kanban` project can resume normal issue/workspace work locally.
- Completed:
  - created a temporary issue in the `vibe-kanban` project
  - created a linked workspace against `_vibe_kanban_repo`
  - verified the workspace appeared under the issue immediately
  - stopped and deleted the temporary workspace
  - deleted the temporary issue
- Verified:
  - local issue creation works
  - local workspace creation works
  - workspace linking/refresh works
- Not complete / known gaps:
  - none blocking normal project work in the `vibe-kanban` board

## 2026-04-19T00:00:00Z | vk/53b2-vk-needs-review | app bar needs-review project bubbles

- Intent: show a project-level visual indicator when a project has linked workspaces with agents that have finished or are waiting for review.
- Completed:
  - added project icon bubbles in the left app bar for projects with review-needed workspaces
  - aggregated review-needed state from existing workspace summary signals
  - added local helper APIs for workspace summaries and local project workspace lookup
  - committed the feature as `5c5f83855`
- Files changed:
  - `packages/ui/src/components/AppBar.tsx`
  - `packages/web-core/src/shared/components/ui-new/containers/SharedAppLayout.tsx`
  - `packages/web-core/src/shared/lib/api.ts`
  - `STREAM.md`
  - `HANDOFF.md`
- Verified:
  - `git diff --check` passed for the touched frontend files
- Not complete / known gaps:
  - `pnpm run format` could not complete because `prettier` was missing
  - `pnpm run check` could not complete because `tsc` was missing
  - original branch push/PR preview state has since changed; see current branch history and PR state instead of this older branch-note wording

## 2026-04-24T00:00:00Z | vk/7b9a-vk-worktree-clea | immediate post-merge worktree cleanup

- Intent: remove workspace worktree folders as soon as a tracked PR lands in `staging` instead of waiting for the archived-workspace retention window.
- Completed:
  - added a shared container helper that deletes archived worktrees for workspaces with merged tracked PRs targeting `staging`
  - called that helper from both the background PR monitor and the attach-existing-PR route
  - added a retry after archive-script completion so archive scripts can finish before the worktree is removed
  - archived linked local workspaces and cleaned up their worktrees when their issues move into `In Staging`, including bulk issue updates
  - documented the new behavior in `VK_WORKFLOW.md`
- Files changed:
  - `crates/services/src/services/container.rs`
  - `crates/services/src/services/pr_monitor.rs`
  - `crates/local-deployment/src/container.rs`
  - `crates/server/src/routes/local_compat.rs`
  - `crates/server/src/routes/workspaces/pr.rs`
  - `VK_WORKFLOW.md`
  - `STREAM.md`
  - `HANDOFF.md`
- Verified:
  - added unit coverage for the merged-to-`staging` PR detection helper
  - `cargo fmt --all` completed
- Not complete / known gaps:
  - full test validation was not rerun after the final cleanup behavior adjustments
  - pinned workspaces still keep the existing auto-archive exception
