## 2026-04-18T00:00:00Z | staging | local-only recovery baseline

- Intent: recover the usable VK board state, remove active cloud coupling, and make the local install restorable.
- Completed:
  - imported the VK cloud export into the local SQLite DB
  - switched the live runtime to local-only behavior (`shared_api_base: null`)
  - restored project settings, local columns, issue creation, workspace linking, and workspace history scroll
  - added lean backup + one-click restore scripts
  - installed hourly backup cron with Desktop archive mirroring
- Verified:
  - local API reports `shared_api_base: null`
  - project boards and issues load locally
  - backups are created locally and mirrored to Desktop
- Not complete / known gaps:
  - some historic metadata can only be reconstructed if present in export or DB snapshots
  - project-scoped PR fallback is still broader than it should be

## 2026-04-19T00:00:00Z | vk/19e5-vk-fix-drag-and | local app bar drag-order persistence
